					<h3>Antibiotics and Antibiotic Resistance</h3>
					<p> Antibiotics are drugs which are used in the treatment of bacterial infections. Several well-known antibiotics were originally isolated from microbial sources and it is thought that these serve the purpose of a defense mechanism for the microbes.</p>
					<p> According to the WHO, antibiotic resistance is the phenomenon by which any bacterial pathogen is able overcome the effects of an antibiotic drug used for the treatment of the disease which the pathogen causes. It is a naturally occurring phenomenon inherent to bacteria owing to their adaptive evolutionary capacity and many environmental (mostly soil) bacteria have an innate antibiotic resistance. </p>

					<h3>How does Antibiotic Resistance arise?</h3>

					<p>As mentioned above, antibiotic resistance being a natural phenomenon, emerges through repeated exposure and evolutionary selection for bacteria which have mechanisms to overcome drug action. Rampant and unrestricted usage accelerates this process rendering the antibiotic resistance to emerge faster. Once antibiotic resistance is acquired, bacteria have specific mechanisms to transfer this capacity and share it to other bacterial species rapidly. And if the recipient bacteria are resistant to a different antibiotic, then it becomes resistant to both drugs. This process iteratively has led to the emergence of MDR (Multiple Drug Resistant) strains of many pathogens which are not treatable by even the most advanced antibiotics.</p>

					<h3>Cross Resistance</h3>

					<p>Although emergence of resistance to a particular antibiotic is largely dependent on exposure that drug, quite often it has been observed that bacterial pathogens acquire tolerance and resistance to other drugs as well. This phenomenon is called antibiotic cross resistance and usually is thought to occur between drugs of similar chemical properties. Although cross-resistance has been observed for almost four decades in individual cases where one drug was tested against another, recent developments in technology have provided a platform to exponentially increase the scale at which these studies can be conducted. Using large scale experiments, recent studies have provided a proof of concept that many clinically important antibiotics have varying degrees of cross resistance to more than one antibiotic. The contribution of cross resistance to clinical antibiotic resistance remains obscure.</p>

					<h3>Burden to Indian Healthcare</h3>

					<p>Current estimates by the WHO and CDDEP indicate that countries like India and China run the greatest risk of losing our utility of our antibiotic arsenal. This risk is even more pronounced in India where a combination of unrestricted access, rampant overuse and general lack of awareness dominates the burden on healthcare. It is a commonplace practice in India where people from a rural background avoid going to the doctor and procure “medicine” directly from the pharmacist without a diagnosis. More specifically, given the tropical climate, India is house to many infectious diseases, some of which are endemic and also depend on the socio-economic strata of the societies in these geographical distributions. Since the treatment of the infection depends on the infectious agent, there is a narrow choice of drugs available for treatment of such cases. This makes the scenario even more hazardous where now on top of antibiotic resistance, cross-resistance to other options also add up.</p>
					<p>This burgeoning problem is further complicated the relatively obscure data available on antibiotic usage. Although the WHO has given rough figures, these observations are skewed owing to the collection of data from very limited sources scattered among socio-economic and geographic strata in India. For example a 2010 CDDEP estimate of antibiotic sales in India is only from two sources which is far from the actual numbers. The other problem of data collection also has its origins from the lack of coordination to maintain centralized EMR (electronic medical record) data in hospitals which can enable the analysis of disease dynamics coupled to antibiotic prescriptions. A concerted effort and in-depth study can reveal patterns of antibiotic usage and emergence of resistance. And since cross resistance can be predicted, prescriptions can be adjusted accordingly.</p>
					<p>The purpose of this portal is to serve as a starting point to initiate collection of EMR and other sales data from different parts of India which can then be analyzed and used for curbing antibiotic resistance.</p>
